## Problem Statement

The real estate market, a cornerstone of the global economy, has always been characterized by its ever-shifting landscape. Buyers and sellers alike are constantly in pursuit of accurately determining the value of a property. This project aims to predict the sales price of a new house by identifying the dependent and independent parameters and creating a machine learning model that considers certain features as given in the dataset. The accuracy of the model is also evaluated.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Housing.csv`, which includes various features related to houses and their sales prices.

### Features

- **Feature 1**
- **Feature 2**
- **Feature 3**
- ...
- **Price** (Target Variable)
